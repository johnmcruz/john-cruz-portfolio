# Intro to Data Science: Project 1

* We were tasked with chosing a TV show, sports team, or food recepie to analyze in R.
* I gathered information about a favorite TV show of mine such as episode title, number of episodes, number of views, and so on.
* Plotted the views of each episode and commented on episodes that had the most views per season.
